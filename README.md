### Hello! ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹

I'm JosÃ© Nieves, a Generalist Senior Software Engineer passionate about making video games. 

Currently working on a [Framework for Unreal Engine](https://github.com/nievesj/unreal-core-framework), basically migrating work that I made for [Unity3D](https://github.com/nievesj/unity-core-project) several years ago. The goal is to help me to prototype features faster.

When I have some free time I also like to keep [FASTBuild](https://github.com/nievesj/FASTBuild) updated and working with Unreal Engine.
